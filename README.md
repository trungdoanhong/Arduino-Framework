# Arduino-Framework
Current library :
- MultiThread : It is not really multi thread. I call that for fun. It just task scheduler. My older version
- TaskScheduler : A better version for task scheduler. I use interrupt to call every function. Exactly and easy to use. 
- SerialCommand : Execute function and save value when receiving command or data from serial port. It better than other version before
- StableButton : Make your buttons in your circuit working like PC keyboard works. Stable and no noise.
